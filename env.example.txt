# Vercel Environment Variables Guide
# ------------------------------------
# 1. In your Vercel project dashboard, go to Settings -> Environment Variables.
# 2. Create the following variables with your actual keys.
# 3. DO NOT wrap the values in quotes.
# 4. For multi-line values like GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY, Vercel handles them correctly when pasted.

# Your Clerk Publishable Key (found in your Clerk dashboard)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# Your Google Gemini API Key (from Google AI Studio)
VITE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...

# --- Google Sheets & Cron Job Secrets (Backend Only) ---
# These are NOT prefixed with VITE_ because they should not be exposed to the frontend.
# Follow the INSTRUCTIONS.md file to get these values.

# The ID of your Google Spreadsheet
SPREADSHEET_ID=1a2b3c4d...

# The client email from your Google Service Account JSON file
GOOGLE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com

# The private key from your Google Service Account JSON file.
# Copy the entire string, including the BEGIN and END markers.
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"

# A secure, random string you generate to protect your cron job endpoint.
CRON_SECRET=your_super_secret_cron_key
